Repository for my personal website.

Built primarily with AngularJS, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome.  Also utilizes Sass, Grunt for JS concat and minification, and the helpful s3_website utility (https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) for easier pushing of site updates to Amazon S3 and having CloudFront invalidated.

Future efforts will feature a backend to handle crawler requests properly and serve them completely static pages, likely in a different repo.
